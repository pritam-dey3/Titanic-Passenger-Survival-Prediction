# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction
getting started with kaggle

This is my first try on any kaggle competetion. I have restrained myself from looking at already available online solutions before starting this project.
And finally got a nice outcome. I have learned a lot about applying machine learning tools as this is my very first project where I used a lot of machine learning tools.
I hope this repository will help the beginners in this field.
